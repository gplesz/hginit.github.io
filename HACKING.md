HgInit is maintained as Jekyll website, using minor Jekyll features for templating, and GitHub Pages for publication.

### minor contributions

For minor contributions, you can use the GitHub user-interface: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files

### local development

To get started with local development, Please install Jekyll. See [detailed guides](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#guides) for your operating system.

To test your changes locally, you can run Jekyll:

```
jekyll serve -w --incremental
```

then open http://localhost:4000 in your browser.

### GitHub Codespaces

You can use GitHub Codespaces to work on the repository remotely. Just run `jekyll serve -w --incremental` in the terminal window, and forward port 4000 to view your changes.
