# [hginit.github.io](https://hginit.github.io)

This is the original hginit.com website by [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/). This is like an archival mirror of the original, since hginit.com is no longer up. Source code was fetched using the Wayback Machine, converted to a minimal Jekyll website, and published via GitHub Pages.

A copy of the source code was also published by @bpollack at [Kiln](https://developers.kilnhg.com/Code/Kiln/HgInit/HgInit). These are kept inside the `artsrc` directory.

The copyright situation is confusing, but I'd love to get this on the original website (`hginit.com`).

# Reading

You can read the tutorial on the website at <https://hginit.github.io>. It is also meant to be readable at GitHub as well:

0. [Subversion Re-education](00.md)
1. [Ground Up Mercurial](01.md)
2. [Setting up for a Team](02.md)
3. [Fixing Goofs](03.md)
4. [Merging](04.md)
4. [Repository Architecture](05.md)

The irony of using Git/GitHub to maintain this project is not lost on me.

# Changes from original

You can visit the original website via [The Web Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20180926172759/http://hginit.com/). Important Changes:

- Switched edit diff system from complex divs and image tags to be more semantic and use `section/del/ins` tags instead.

    sample output text and input commands typed within a terminal session.

  - Use `dfn` tags for cheat tips which define hg commands
  - Use `<header/footer/main>`
